# Fast CLI

This is a Dart CLI used mainly in Flutter projects. It takes a separately made plugin as required, which can generate templates that could include any desired code in any specified directory location. So simple Right? ðŸ˜ƒ

## Installation

To get it activated run the below command :

```
dart pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/dev-ideausher/iu.cli-master.git

After that, you need to set the Environmental path variable:

```

To deactivate you can use :

```
